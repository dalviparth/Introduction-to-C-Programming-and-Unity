This course is all about where I started to learn how to develop video games using the C# programming language and the Unity game engine on Windows. Why use C# and Unity instead of some other language and game engine? Well, C# is a really good language for learning how to program and then programming professionally. C# is one of the programming languages you can use in the Unity environment.

Module 1: Write your first C# console application and Unity script 

Module 2: Learn how we store data in our programs

Module 3: Learn how we use classes and objects to implement our code

Module 4: Learn the basics of Unity 2D games and take "Final Exam"
