/*
Problem 4 â€“ Calculating with integers
Create a new C# Console Application named Exercise4.

In the Main method, do the following:

  1. Prompt for and get the altitude for a location as an int.
  2. Prompt for and get the altitude for a second location as an int.
  3. Calculate and display the altitude change you'd experience moving from the first point to the second point.
 
Hint: The order of the subtraction matters, so make sure you're getting the correct sign on your answer.
